# Final
# What Have You Accomplished
This course was a full 24 weeks. There were definitely times where I felt like I struggled with juggling school work with my actual job work. Long hours of work transforming into nights in class, followed by studying and practicing. This all had me feeling like I wanted to rip out my hair in frustration some nights. Looking back, I can honestly say how impressed I am with myself. I am not saying that the work was easy, not at all. 

Looking back, I can see how far I have come. If someone would have asked me to extract, transform, and load data 24 weeks ago, I would have looked at them crosseyed and confused. Now, I would think on which tools to use. What data do I need to look at and clean? Can I throw it in Tableau and create a neat visualization for it? This is the output of all my hardwork and determination and I can honsetly say that I am PROUD of myself.

## Team Assessment
My initial thought when my instructor stated we would be working in groups for our final project was a bit worrisome, at first. I had to work on my entire MBA project in a team so I am used to the logistics behind group work. Even still, I was a bit apprehensive at first. What would be our roles? Would we get along and work well together? Is there going to be a person lagging and taking credit for our hard work? These were all genuine concerns I had at first. 

Once we were all grouped, I was breathed a sigh of relief since I had been paired with a group of women I had worked previously with during class projects. They all shared similar aspects as I did when it came to splitting the work and coming up with solutions, so that was a huge relief. We all worked extremely well with one another and split up tasks evenly. I had been tasked with the Machine Learning portion and I was a bit nervous as it can be confusing and difficult to train the models. Even still, my team had my back and gave pointers or their thought processes and I was able to get a working model (after our second attempt with the data). I am proud of my team and the way we worked so cohesively with one another.

# Summary of the Final Project
My team and I had decided to pull our dataset from Kaggle. We were not sure as to what we would want to work with so we met with one another and looked through some of the available datasets on the site. Being that we all live in Arizona, we decided to work with the UFO dataset. Once we downloaded the file, our next step was to think through what we wanted to learn from the information available. Our initial thought was, can we predict where the next UFO sighting would be in the state of Arizona? Once we cleaned the data and created a pandas dataframe, we noticed that initial question may be a bit too hard to figure out. The data itself was a mess, so we had to narrow down our sights and come up with a better question. We then decided to look into whether more UFO sightings occur in densly populated cities.

Once we created our dataframe, cleaned the data and merged AZ populations from the World Population and Census, we were ready to move forward with our next step. We then utilized AWS and PostgresQL and created tables to inspect the data more thoroughly. We then took our information and moved forward with the next step, our Machine Learning models. We decided since to move forward with an unsupervised model, focusing on clusters and the elbow method. Once these steps were completed, we then created visualizations (interactive ones that we could show in real time) using Power BI. Based on our final project presentation and the number of questions we received, I think I can say confidently that our presentation was a success.

# Results
Now looking back from the beginning to the end, I can say that this course was worth it. It was worth the stress, long nights, and the non-stop knowledge I retained during these 24 weeks. I thank my instructors and my classmates for this experience and cannot wait to use these skillsets.
